# Engineering Core


The following 3 lessons should be done in the first weeks of the course, ideally just before starting the C# Core weeks.
Adding new random lines.


[Markdown](./Markdown.md)  

[Shell Scripting](./ShellScripting.md)

[Git/GitHub](./Git_Intro.md)

The advanced Git/GitHub lesson below should be done just before they do their first group exercise or mini-project

[Collaborative development using Git/GitHub](./Git_Collaborative.md)

[Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions](./CI_GitHub_Actions/)
